# 🤖 StudyBot - Your Study Partner

StudyBot is a colorful and beginner-friendly chatbot interface made for a hackathon. It simulates an AI tutor using **demo fallback replies**, and includes a smartly crafted **"Generate Study Plan"** feature to help students structure their learning.



## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Design:** Custom UI with fun icons, chat bubbles, and pastel themes  
- **AI Integration (Planned):** OpenAI or OpenRouter (temporarily disabled)



## 🎯 Features

- ✨ Chat UI with user + bot bubbles  
- 📤 Sends user input to backend  
- 📢 Demo fallback replies for all questions  
- 🗓️ Generate Study Plan button — gives a sample 7-day schedule  
- 💻 Backend using Express (API simulation)



## 💬 How Demo Chat Works

Every time a user types something, StudyBot gives a fallback reply like:

> 📢 Demo Reply: StudyBot AI didn't return a valid answer. This is a fallback demo response.

✅ This proves the full-stack flow without relying on real AI.
